Most functions used had a cylcomatic complexity of 3. --> Less than 10 woohoo!

We have an LCOM4 of 1 (which is great), because all of our functions are related.
If we want to keep track of competitors different wins we'll want to use a map of "elements".
Each "element" will have the competitors name and numWins. When a competitor wins, we'll first
search to see if their name (or ID) already exists, so we can just ++numWins.
